# Connect Messenger Notification (2020 Project)
<p>
A simple python script to send me a messenger notification whenever Connect 4G Prepay has a promotion. App was developed for personal convenience. Unreleased to avoid copyright and trademark infringements and issues. 
</p>

<p>
Script uses webscraping to check if a promotions is currently active and checks for a promotion every 24 hours. Only one notification per promotion is received so if a promotions spans 3 days, only one notification is received for that promo. However, if promotion changes, notification for both promos will be received. 
</p>

## Project Information
1. Developed using python with fbchat (facebook interaction) and beautiful soup (web scraping) libraries.
2. To run the script:
    1. Open 'main.py' and edit the constants at the top of the file (from 'CONNECT_UNAME' to 'FRIEND_NAME'. For security reasons, this info could not be included).
    2. Run the python script by executing 'python main.py' in command prompt. Ensure that the current directory is set to the location of the script.
