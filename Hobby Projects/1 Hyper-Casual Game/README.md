Simple hypercasual game made for android and Facebook. The game has not been released yet but plans are to release it by July end. [Executables are available here](https://github.com/shahilpravind/portfolio/releases)

## Project Information
0. Project files are in the folder labelled 'Release'.

2. Executables page contains 2 versions, web and desktop. Desktop version is a windows portable executable and can be run directly (does not require installation). Web version requires a server.
3. Easiest way to run web version is using 'Live Server' extension with 'Visual Studio Code'.

May take a minute for the 'Live Server' button to show up after opening the directory.
