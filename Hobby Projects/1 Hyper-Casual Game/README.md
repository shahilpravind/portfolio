# Simple Game - Dia (2020 Project)
Simple hypercasual game made for android and Facebook. The game has not been released yet but plans are to release it by July end. [Executables are available here](https://github.com/shahilpravind/portfolio/releases)

## Project Information
1. Development: Unity game engine (2019.4), C# for scripting.
2. Executables page contains 2 versions, web and desktop. Desktop version is a windows portable executable and can be run directly (does not require installation). Web version requires a server.
3. Easiest way to run web version is using 'Live Server' extension with 'Visual Studio Code'. Simply install the extension, open directory in vs code and click the 'Live Server' button in the bottom right side of the bottom blue bar. May take a minute for the 'Live Server' button to show up after opening the directory.
