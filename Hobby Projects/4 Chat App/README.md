# Chat App (Dec 2017 Project)

This project was accidentally deleted permanently and thus, there is no demo or screenshots. The app allowed person-to-person as well as group conversations via text. Video or voice calls were not supported. File uploades including images, pdf, videos, etc were planned however, I was not able to add them before the project was deleted.
