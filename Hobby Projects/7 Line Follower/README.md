# Line Follower Experiment (2018 Project)
<p>
A simple line following robot experiment. The video is a sample of what the robot sees moving forward while the red/blue lines dictate its path. Project was a proof of concept and early demo, did not continue with it since didn't have an actual robot to test with.
