# Deep Learning Based Fish Counting (2019 Project)
This project was made for a 4th year engineering student's project. The project directory in its entirety is very large (about 12gb) and has a complex setup, hence, it has not been uploaded to GitHub. If a demo of this project is desired, please contact the owner of this repository through the contact details on his CV.

## Screenshots and Video Demo

Will be uploaded soon.
